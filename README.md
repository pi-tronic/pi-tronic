### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a student of Computer Science in Germany.

Check out my cool projects and donâ€™t forget my github organisation [@Turbo-Turtles](https://github.com/Turbo-Turtles).

There I was working in a team with ROS2 and the TurtleBot3 to create an autonomous driving bot performing the AutoRace 2020 track.
